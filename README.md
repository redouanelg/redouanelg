### Welcome to my Github page

I am interested in Machine learning for oceanic, atmospheric and climate sciences. My PhD thesis consisted in the use of analog methods (K-Nearest Neighbor Regression) to develop a new data-driven approach to tackle data assimilation: the Analog Data Assimilation (AnDA). In parallel to my thesis I investigated the use of deep learning methods for the segmentation of oceanic eddies from satellite-derived sea related maps.

Currently, I am a postdoc at LSCE-IPSL (CEA Saclay) and LOCEAN-IPSL (Sorbonne Universit√©) in Paris, France. I am investigating how to use machine learning methods for numerical modeling with a focus on physical oceanography.

In my spare time, I make machine learning courses in Darija (Moroccan Arabic), check for example my recent collaboration with [Alfihrya Academy](https://github.com/Al-Fihriya-Academy/Machine-Learning).
